# PROJECT_OS
Slice is a simple operating system kernel developed in C/C++ as a learning project. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of operating system concepts and kernel development principles. This project is intended for educational purposes and as a platform for experimenting with various kernel functionalities.

# Motivation
My main motivation behind working on this project was to put my understanding of Operating systems and C to the test. And also to learn new concepts as I proceed.
